First off, if you have not tried, I'd highly suggest checking the common troubleshooting steps in the #rage-troubleshooting channel, they seem to help lots of people and also come with official advice directly from RageMP Developers.

If that does not seem to help you out, try the following three guides:

TRY ME SECOND - https://forum.gta.world/en/topic/42649-fix-game-crashing-shortly-after-pressing-play-rockstar-launcher-edition%C2%A0/?tab=comments#comment-405147
TRY ME THIRD - https://forum.gta.world/en/topic/42835-fix-r-games-launcher-downloading-when-opening-rage-then-closes/?tab=comments#comment-407261

If the above does not appear to help you out and your issue started appearing after the last update, downloading the following and dragging and dropping it into your GTA V folder seemed to help a lot of people:

If any of the above resolutions does not work, I highly suggest joining the RageMP Discord and asking for assistance in their dedicated support channels as they may be able to assist you further:
